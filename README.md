# ImageRecognition

Entry point to 2D shape recognition problem.

## Scope

This program accept 24-bit bmp binary image and build cyclic graph of polygons which covers initial binary image. 
These polygons can be used for sceletonization procedure.

## Approach
Building graph of pixels of the original image and reduction this graph to graph of polygons.

## Requirements
Only 24-bit bmp binary image now supported.
